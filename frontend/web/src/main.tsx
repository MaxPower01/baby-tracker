/*
  Note from official React docs:

    Strict mode canâ€™t automatically detect side effects for you, 
    but it can help you spot them by making them a little more deterministic.
    This is done by intentionally double-invoking the following functions:

    - Class component constructor, render, and shouldComponentUpdate methods
    - Class component static getDerivedStateFromProps method
    - Function component bodies
    - State updater functions (the first argument to setState)
    - Functions passed to useState, useMemo, or useReducer

    This only applies to development mode. Lifecycles will not be double-invoked in production mode.
  
  Reference: https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html#detecting-unexpected-side-effects

  This is why all components are rendered twice in development mode.
